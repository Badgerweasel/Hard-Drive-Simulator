# Hard Drive Simulator
 A hard Drive simulator done for CS 315

The purpose of the project was to use various sorting methods to see which one would be the most effecient way to prioritize requests to retrieve memory from the hard drive. In order to do this I was also required to construct an algorithm which simulated a hard drive retriving the inormation by using certain assumptions about how long certain steps took. After the program has run it will create a file named SUMMARY_output which contains data about each sorting method.

To run:
-run the makefile
-run ./simulation.x < sim.in
-read the output contained in any of the Summary files
