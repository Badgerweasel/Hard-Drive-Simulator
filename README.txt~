My project is capable of reading an input file that stores the input in the following manner:

Time Track Sector

My program does not validate input and will attempt to run with bad input. It will output information to the following files:

FCFS_output
SAMETRACK_output
PICKUP_output
LOOK_output
CLOOK_output
SUMMARY_output

At the moment there areno known problems with my program.
